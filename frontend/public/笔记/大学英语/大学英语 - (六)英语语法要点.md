## 6. 英语语法要点

### 6.1 技术写作常用时态

#### 时态选择指南

| 时态 | 使用场景 | 技术写作示例 |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **一般现在时** | 普遍真理、事实描述 | "Python is an interpreted language." |
| **现在进行时** | 正在进行的研究 | "We are currently implementing..." |
| **现在完成时** | 已完成但影响现在 | "Recent studies have shown that..." |
| **一般过去时** | 实验步骤、具体工作 | "We designed and implemented..." |
| **过去完成时** | 过去之前完成的事 | "After we had tested the system..." |
| **一般将来时** | 未来工作、展望 | "Future work will focus on..." |

#### 时态混合使用示例

**学术论文摘要：**
```
Deep learning **has become** (现在完成时) one of the most important technologies 
in artificial intelligence. However, training deep neural networks **requires** 
(一般现在时) large amounts of data and computational resources. 

In this paper, we **propose** (一般现在时) a novel approach that **reduces** 
(一般现在时) training time by 40%. We **conducted** (一般过去时) experiments on 
three benchmark datasets and **achieved** (一般过去时) state-of-the-art results. 

The findings **suggest** (一般现在时) that our method **can be** (情态动词+be) 
effectively applied to other domains.
```

### 6.2 句子结构与复杂句

#### 简单句 vs 复杂句

**简单句（Simple Sentence）：**
```
The algorithm runs efficiently.
The system processes data in real-time.
```

**并列句（Compound Sentence）：**
```
The algorithm is fast, but it requires more memory.
We tested the system, and the results were positive.
```

**复合句（Complex Sentence）：**
```
Although the algorithm is fast, it requires more memory.
The system works well when the input data is clean.
Because we optimized the code, the performance improved significantly.
```

#### 技术写作中的句子变化

**避免重复单调：**

❌ **重复单调：**
```
The system is fast. The system is reliable. The system is scalable.
```

✅ **句式多样：**
```
The system is fast and reliable. Moreover, it scales well under heavy load.
```

**长短句结合：**
```
Our approach is novel. (短) It combines machine learning with traditional 
statistical methods to achieve better performance than existing solutions. (长) 
This makes it particularly suitable for real-world applications. (中)
```

### 6.3 冠词使用（a/an/the）

#### 技术写作中的冠词规则

**不定冠词 a/an：**
```
✅ "We propose a new algorithm..."  (首次提及)
✅ "This is an interesting approach..."  (泛指)
✅ "The system can handle a million requests per second."  (数量)
```

**定冠词 the：**
```
✅ "The algorithm we proposed..."  (特指，前文提到)
✅ "The Internet has changed..."  (独一无二)
✅ "The performance of the system..."  (特定的性能)
```

**零冠词（不用冠词）：**
```
✅ "Machine learning is important."  (抽象概念)
✅ "Data shows that..."  (不可数名词，泛指)
✅ "Python is widely used."  (专有名词)
```

#### 常见错误

| 错误 | 正确 |
|------|------|
| ❌ "The Python is popular." | ✅ "Python is popular." |
| ❌ "We use machine learning." | ✅ "We use machine learning." (不加冠词) |
| ❌ "Algorithm is efficient." | ✅ "The algorithm is efficient." (特指时加the) |
| ❌ "We proposed the new method." | ✅ "We proposed a new method." (首次提及用a) |

### 6.4 介词使用

#### 介词短语练习

| 中文 | 英文短语 |
|------|----------|

### 6.5 连接词与过渡词

#### 逻辑关系连接词

**因果关系：**
- therefore, thus, hence, consequently, as a result
- because, since, as, due to, owing to
- Example: "The cache was full. Therefore, the system slowed down."

**对比关系：**
- however, nevertheless, nonetheless, in contrast
- while, whereas, although, despite, in spite of
- Example: "Method A is fast. However, it requires more memory."

**递进关系：**
- moreover, furthermore, in addition, additionally
- also, besides, what's more
- Example: "The system is fast. Moreover, it's energy-efficient."

**举例说明：**
- for example, for instance, such as, namely
- specifically, particularly, in particular
- Example: "Many languages support OOP, such as Java and C++."

**总结关系：**

```

### 6.6 主动语态 vs 被动语态

#### 在技术写作中的选择

**主动语态（更直接、清晰）：**
```
✅ "We implemented the algorithm in Python."
✅ "The system processes 1000 requests per second."
✅ "Our approach reduces memory usage by 30%."
```

**被动语态（强调动作而非执行者）：**
```
✅ "The data was collected from three sources."
✅ "The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions."
✅ "The results are shown in Table 1."
```

#### 使用建议

**优先主动语态：**
- 描述你的贡献：" We developed..."
- 清晰表达：优先使用主动语态使句子更直接

**适用被动语态：**
- 动作比执行者重要："The code was optimized..."
- 执行者未知或不重要："The bug was fixed."
- 学术写作传统："The experiment was designed to..."
