### 5.3 常见面试问题及回答

#### 技术基础问题

**Q: What's the difference between a stack and a queue?**

A: "A stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top. A queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Stacks are useful for function calls and undo operations, while queues are used in scheduling and breadth-first search."

**Q: Explain object-oriented programming.**

A: "Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). The four main principles are:
- Encapsulation: bundling data and methods together
- Inheritance: creating new classes based on existing ones
- Polymorphism: objects of different types responding to the same interface
- Abstraction: hiding complex implementation details"

#### 项目经验问题

**Q: Tell me about a challenging project you worked on.**

A: "I worked on a [project type] that involved [brief description]. The main challenge was [specific problem]. I approached this by [solution approach]. The most difficult part was [specific difficulty] because [reason]. I overcame this by [specific actions]. The final result was [outcome] and I learned [lessons learned]."

**Q: How do you handle debugging?**

A: "My debugging process typically involves:
1. Reproducing the issue consistently
2. Using logging to trace the execution flow
3. Isolating the problem by testing smaller components
4. Using debugging tools like breakpoints and step-through debugging
5. Consulting documentation and searching for similar issues
6. If stuck, I'll ask colleagues for a fresh perspective"

#### 行为问题

**Q: How do you stay updated with new technologies?**

A: "I stay current through several methods:
- Following tech blogs and newsletters like [specific examples]
- Participating in online communities like Stack Overflow and Reddit
- Taking online courses on platforms like Coursera and Udemy
- Working on personal projects to experiment with new technologies
- Attending local meetups and conferences when possible"

**Q: Describe a time when you had to learn something quickly.**

A: "When I joined a project that used [technology], I had only [timeframe] to get up to speed. I created a learning plan that included [specific steps]. I practiced by [specific actions] and asked [specific people] for guidance. Within [timeframe], I was able to [specific achievement]. This experience taught me the importance of structured learning and seeking help when needed."
